Case + Code Overview
--------------------

This repository is part of Real-Time Innovations' Case + Code project,
a project to create code for real-world RTI Connext DDS use cases.

This use case shows how Connext DDS can be used by Autonomous Vehicle 
developers to leverage RTI’s extensive experience with autonomous 
robotics, safety-critical systems and state-of-the-art architectures 
to simplify development, design and integration.

This use case example should be a stepping stone for creating real
distributed applications based on RTI Connext DDS. Additional information
about this use case can be found on
[RTI's Case + Code page](https://www.rti.com/resources/usecases/automotive).

RTI Connext DDS Overview
------------------------
RTI Connext DDS software includes the world's leading implementation of the
Object Management Group (OMG) Data Distribution Service (DDS). DDS is the only
open standard for messaging that supports the unique needs of both enterprise
and real-time systems. Its open interfaces and advanced integration
capabilities slash costs across a system's lifecycle, from initial development
and integration through on-going maintenance and upgrades.
