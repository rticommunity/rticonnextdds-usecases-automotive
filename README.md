Case + Code Overview
--------------------
This repository is part of Real-Time Innovations' Case + Code project,
a project to create code for real-world RTI Connext DDS use cases.

The example in this repository is meant to illustrate simplified real-world
uses of the RTI Connext DDS product, focusing on:


This use case example should be a stepping stone for creating real
distributed applications based on RTI Connext DDS. Additional information
about this use case can be found on [RTI's Case + Code page](http://www.rti.com/resources/usecases/index.html)
and in the Docs/ directory of the use case example.

RTI Connext DDS Overview
------------------------
RTI Connext DDS software includes the world's leading implementation of the
Object Management Group (OMG) Data Distribution Service (DDS). DDS is the only
open standard for messaging that supports the unique needs of both enterprise
and real-time systems. Its open interfaces and advanced integration
capabilities slash costs across a system's lifecycle, from initial development
and integration through on-going maintenance and upgrades.
